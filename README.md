Portfolio Webpage

This webpage serves as a portfolio for my current and future work. I wanted a way to give a potential employer a sample of my work in a clear, easy to navigate format with information about me and how to contact me. 

To use this webpage either scroll to see content or click on one of the links at the top to jump to a section. Clicking on the images on my work brings the user to my live webpages. Clicking on the links in the contact section brings the user to the corresponding method of contact. 

This webpage is formatted to be used on any size screen.
